Interim Report — Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Date: 2026-02-01
Repository: Forecasting-Financial-Inclusion-in-Ethiopia
Branch: task-2
Author: Faysal

1) Objective
The objective of Task 2 is to analyze patterns, relationships, and drivers of financial inclusion in Ethiopia, focusing on Access (account ownership) and Usage (digital payments). The EDA specifically investigates the 2021–2024 slowdown (+3pp in access) despite large supply-side expansions, and highlights recent 2025 data points added during Task 1 enrichment.

2) Data Sources and Scope
- Primary dataset: Unified financial inclusion dataset (raw + enriched). 
- Enriched inputs from Task 1 (2025/early-2026):
  - Mobile money registered accounts: 136 million (2025).
  - CICO agents: ~500,000 (mid-2025).
  - Internet penetration: 21.7% (end-2025).
  - NDPS 2026–2030 policy event (Dec 2025).
  - Disaggregated account ownership (men/women, urban/rural, income groups).
- Data includes events, observations, and impact links.

3) Methods and EDA Workflow
- Load enriched dataset (processed preferred; fallback to raw).
- Filter observations for quantitative trend analysis.
- Plot time trends for Access (ACC_OWNERSHIP) and compare against supply-side metrics (registered accounts, agents, internet penetration).
- Disaggregation by gender and urban/rural for 2024 account ownership.
- Overlay policy/market events as markers on key trends.
- Summarize correlations among a subset of numeric indicators (when overlapping time points exist).

4) Key Findings (Evidence-Based)
1. Account ownership stagnation vs. supply boom:
   - Access increased only +3pp from 2021 to 2024 (46% → 49%).
   - Meanwhile, mobile money registered accounts surged to 136M in 2025.
   - Conclusion: Massive supply-side expansion has not translated into equivalent demand-side inclusion.

2. Persistent gender gap:
   - 2024 Findex disaggregation shows men at 57% vs women at 42% (15pp gap).
   - This persistent gap limits overall inclusion progress and indicates structural barriers for women.

3. Urban–rural divide:
   - Urban account ownership ~73% vs rural ~43% (2024).
   - Rural access remains far behind despite growth in agent networks.

4. Usage activation gap:
   - Digital payment usage remains relatively low compared to registration growth.
   - Internet penetration is only 21.7% by end-2025, constraining app-based usage.
   - This suggests that infrastructure growth needs complementary activation strategies (merchant payments, salaries, government transfers).

5. Policy momentum with lagged impact:
   - Telebirr launch (2021) and M-Pesa entry (2023) coincide with strong supply-side momentum but minimal access acceleration.
   - NDPS 2026–2030 (Dec 2025) is a major policy signal aimed at usage activation and interoperability; impacts expected in 2026–2027.

6. Data gaps and limitations:
   - Demand-side data is periodic (Findex waves), limiting annual trend resolution.
   - Supply metrics (registrations) may overstate active usage due to duplicates or dormant accounts.

5) Visualizations Produced
- Access vs supply-side growth (dual-axis plot: ACC_OWNERSHIP vs SUP_MM_REGISTERED_ACCOUNTS).
- Gender and urban/rural disaggregation bar charts (2024 Findex).
- Infrastructure enablers trend (CICO agents and internet penetration).
- Event overlays (Telebirr, M-Pesa, NDPS) on account ownership trend.
- Correlation heatmap for selected numeric indicators.

6) Data Quality Assessment (Summary)
- Temporal gaps: Findex waves are periodic (2011, 2014, 2017, 2021, 2024).
- Confidence distribution: High for World Bank/NBE; medium for projections and derived metrics.
- Supply vs demand mismatch: Registrations overstate active usage.
- Coverage limitations: Some regions may be under-represented in surveys due to instability.
- Strength: Unified schema supports consistent cross-pillar analysis.

7) Implications for Modeling (Next Steps)
- Include supply-side indicators (agents, registered accounts, internet penetration) as predictors, but model a lagged/partial translation to Access and Usage.
- Introduce policy events (NDPS) as binary or time-lagged covariates.
- Consider segmentation (gender, urban/rural) for scenario analysis and forecasting.
