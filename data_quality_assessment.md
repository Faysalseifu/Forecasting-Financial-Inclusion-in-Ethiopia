# Data Quality Assessment (Task 2)

- **Temporal gaps**: Findex waves are periodic (2011, 2014, 2017, 2021, 2024), limiting annual trend granularity.
- **Confidence distribution**: High for World Bank/NBE; medium for projections or derived metrics.
- **Supply vs demand mismatch**: Registered accounts overstate active usage; duplicates likely.
- **Coverage limitations**: Some surveys may exclude regions or have conflict-related disruptions.
- **Strength**: Unified schema allows consistent cross-pillar comparison.
